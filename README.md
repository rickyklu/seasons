# Usage
Upon running `npm start` the page should open. When the page requests to access location, the user has two choices:
1. Allow location access. Page will update and indicate either it is cold (winter) or suggest going to the beach (summer).
2. Deny location access or some error fetching the geolocation. The page will render a message an error message accordingly.
